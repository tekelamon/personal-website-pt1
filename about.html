                <h2>Star Wars</h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been a major Star Wars nerd. My first experience was wathcing Revenge of the Sith with my mother when I was 6.
                    Since then it's been a love bordering on obsession; from playing the games, watching the shows and movies, to reading comics.
                    My favorite game is Knights of the Old Republic and my favorite movie is Revenge of the Sith.
                    <span>It started the Star Wars love for me. And who doesn't love the Obi-Ani duel?</span>

                    If the Star Wars paragraph didn't warn you, I'm a huge nerd.
                    My first experience with a computer was my Dad's old dinosaur of a computer collecting dust in his office.
                    It never quite interested me until one day he brought home a copy of DOOM. We stayed up all night slaying extremely
                    pixelated demons and <i>definitely</i> didn't get in any trouble with my Mom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there I had to know what magic turned that dusty old box into the coolest thing man ever made.
                    I started to take the computer apart looking for it's secrets - I had to know how it worked.
                    Before learning about the world of software development, I would explore the limitations of games.
                    I would test them in different ways to see what worked and what would make them break.
                    I had no idea that it would only be the beginning for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since, I kept learning more about each game, each gaming console, each computer. I took each one apart
                    and eventually got to testing mods and trying to change the games. I learned about programming from friends and fell in love.
                    It's all my Dad's fault, I could have been cool...
