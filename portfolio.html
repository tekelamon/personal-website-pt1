                So, there's a list of small projects that I had stored locally on my old computer that I used regularly.
                However, at the beginning of this class, I happened to break that computer... with a backup!
                I just can't access the data quickly enough for this project.
                Lesson learned. My favorite projects are listed below, and I will be working to recreate them, better than before.
                And on GitHub....

            <p>A large portion of my learning is self taught. I have taken classes both in person and online ranging from:</p>

                <li>Basic computer science principles in high school</li>
                <li>C++ Programming through Udemy</li>
                <li>Python through SoloLearn</li>
                <li>2 years and approximately 9 (CS) classes at Victor Valley College</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have no degree as of yet, but do plan on continuing college for personal reasons.</p>
